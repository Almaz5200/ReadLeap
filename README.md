# ReadLeap
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/oyFn72hkcLA
#### Description: ReadLeap is an app for parents to teach their children (1-3 years) to read individual words.
It achieves this by allowing parent to record their voice, then uses speech recognition to transcribe it and later those words can be shown to a kid with a recording playback. Also there are some additional features like iCloud syncronization or an archive. It was actually made on my dad's request because he has a 1 year old son whom he wanted to teach that way, and most of app's features like syncronization and archive came in part from his request.

This requests were very valuable. For example, it's not that obvious why an app like that would need something like an iCloud syncronization, but there is a very interesting use case there: he would leave his iPad at home while going to work while babysitter would look after my brother, and with that feature he would be able to make new recordings at work or anywhere else and babysitter was able to just show child this recordings few times a day.

I also opted for "The Composable Architecture" with this project because it's kind of a trend in an iOS Development world right now and I wanted to try it out. I am not sure if it's me who didn't understand this or it's generally not very good, but I did regret this decision later in project.
In a last week I made some huge renovations to this app, including but not limited to fixing a lot of bugs, adding new languages and features like "Show always in caps" and "Every word on a new line", which both came from my dad's feedback as well
